# Coursera-Deep-Learning-Specialization

### Course 01
***
First Course on Neural Network from Scratch. This course gives foundations of neural networks and deep learning. All of the programming exercises are done by Python without using any framework.

### Course 02
***
The second course on a different kind of optimization & hyperparameter tuning. Such as,
* Bias / Variance
* Regularization
* Dropout Regularization
* Normalization
* Vanishing / Exploding gradients
* Weight Initialization for Deep Networks
* Numerical approximation of gradients
* Mini-batch gradient descent
* Exponentially weighted averages
* Bias correction in exponentially weighted averages
* Gradient descent with momentum
* RMSprop
* Adam optimization algorithm
* Learning rate decay

In this course, we learn about the famous deep learning framework Tensorflow.


### Course 03
*** 
In this course, we learn how to structure learning machine projects. The material in this course is relatively unique.

### Course 04
In this course we learn about Keras, CNN. This course is full of projects. 
* Sign Language Detection
* Autonomous Driving Object detection
* Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer
* Face Verification & Face_Recognition
